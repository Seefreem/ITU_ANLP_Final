It is sometimes used when addressing a younger adult woman, For example, `` May I help you, Miss ? '' In the United States, The titles of `` Ma'am '' or `` Madam '' are sometimes used instead of `` Miss. '' Use of these terms implies marital status. Some take offense to the use of `` Ma'am '' or `` Madam '' because it indicates that the speaker thinks the woman being addressed must certainly be married due to her apparent age, And some take offense to the use of the terms `` Ma'am '' or `` Madam '' because of their association with houses of ill repute. On the other hand, Addressing a woman as `` Miss '' may be taken as patronizing."
